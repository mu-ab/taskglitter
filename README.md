This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About Repo

### - This is a project I used to follow along with the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quNLtK7hWYs&pp=ygU5SG93IG5leHRqcyBhbmQgcHJpc21hIG1ha2UgZnJvbnRlbmQgZGV2ZWxvcGVycyBmdWxsLXN0YWNr) (How Next.js and Prisma make frontend developers fullstack)

- I couldn't follow the tutorial completely because there was a lot of pre-written code, it was more of a fast paced talk rather than a "code it all on screen tutorial"

- This repo can be used to boostrap any project that uses, Nextjs, Typescript and all the prisma set-up already done.

- I do not intend to continue with the tutorial, but to use this repo to scafold new nextjs project with Typescript and Prisma

- The repo for the talk can be found at [this link](https://github.com/ahaywood/taskglitter__nextjs)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
